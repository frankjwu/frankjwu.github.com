title: My CS50 Section Slides
---

Fall of 2015 introduced the whirlwind that is Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) to Yale, quickly becoming ["the most popular course in Yale College."](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/09/22/cs50-yales-most-popular-course/) Providing a strong support network, particularly one spearheaded by other students, is one of the key pedagogical backbones of the course. At Yale, this took the shape of a team of 29 students hosting nightly question and debugging sessions, weekly 90-minute teaching sections, and a slew of other [activities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SWtexks-dk) like a [hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qGmeb65K1I&list=PLhQjrBD2T382chRPBfekwPyErmNgRq_2_) and the [CS50 Fair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWw28ZwjQvE).

I've compiled all of my personal teaching slides from the Fall 2015 semester below.
