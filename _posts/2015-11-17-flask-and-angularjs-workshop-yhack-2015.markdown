title: Flask and AngularJS Workshop (YHack 2015)
---

My friend [Mike](http://mikewuis.me) and I recently prepared a quick Flask and AngularJS workshop for [YHack 2015](http://yhack.org) (the first YHack in which the two of us did not serve as directors!). Our talk teaches basic backend and frontend web development via the development of a basic blackjack game.
