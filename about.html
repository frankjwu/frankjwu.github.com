<h1 class="title">Hi! Nice to meet you.</h1>

<p><img id="about" src="/images/Frank Wu.png" alt="Frank Wu">I'm Frank Wu. I love to learn, tinker, and create beautiful things.</p>

<p>These days, I'm building <a href="https://tarohealth.com">Taro Health</a> in NYC. We're on a mission to bring affordable, high-quality healthcare to more Americans.</p>

<p>As a student at Yale, I encouraged others to learn how to program and build cool things. I cofounded <a href="http://yhack.org/">YHack</a>, Yale's annual 1000 person hackathon; started <a href="http://codeblue.yhack.org/">CodeBlue</a>, a day-long coding bootcamp for 300-some New Haven high school students; and served as a teaching assistant for <a href="https://cs50.yale.edu/">CS50</a>, where I taught a 90-minute section, graded problem sets, and held office hours.</p>

<p>Along the way, I've also worked at <a href="https://www.marriott.com/">Marriott</a> as a management intern, at software startup <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/">Honey</a> as an early engineer, and started a <a href="http://lostinthesound.com/">music blog</a> that interviewed Grammy Award winning artists.</p>

<p>If you're working on something cool, <b>I'd love to meet you!</b> Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:me@frankjwu.com">me@frankjwu.com</a> or find me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/frankjwu">@frankjwu</a>.</p>
