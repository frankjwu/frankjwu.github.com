<h1 class="title">Hi! Nice to meet you.</h1>

<p>I'm Frank Wu. I love to learn, tinker, and create beautiful things.</p>

<p>As a student at Yale, I encouraged others to learn how to program and build cool things. I cofounded <a href="http://yhack.org/">YHack</a>, Yale's annual 1000 person hackathon; started <a href="http://codeboola.yhack.org/">CodeBoola</a>, a day-long coding bootcamp for 300-some New Haven high school students; and served as a teaching assistant for <a href="https://cs50.yale.edu/">CS50</a>, where I taught a 90-minute section, graded problem sets, and held office hours.</p>

<p>Along the way, I've also worked at <a href="http://www.marriott.com/">Marriott</a> as a management intern, at software startup <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/">Honey</a> as an early engineer, and started a <a href="http://lostinthesound.com/">music blog</a> that interviewed Grammy Award winning artists.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm based in New Haven, Connecticut and attend <a href="http://yale.edu/">Yale University</a>. I've moved quite a bit in my life, but I currently call Augusta, Georgia "home."</p>
