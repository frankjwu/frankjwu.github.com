<div class="title">Hi! Nice to meet you.</div>
<p>I'm Frank Wu, a lifelong student and creator transfixed by the ubiquity of the Internet and its ability to connect and change the world. I want to solve problems with innovation and creative thinking.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm based in New Haven, Connecticut and attend <a href="http://yale.edu/">Yale University</a>. At times, you may find me in Shanghai, China, the city in which I attended high school.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also find me on the web:</p>
